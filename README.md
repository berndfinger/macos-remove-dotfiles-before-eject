# macos-remove-dotfiles-before-eject
Prepares a removable medium (e.g. a USB stick) before removal and removes it

The script rmdot.sh deletes all files which might have been created on a removable medium (e.g. USB stick) by MacOS and then ejects the medium.

I have used this script for several years and I have never lost any data.

Important notes:
1) Use with care!
2) Play around and test before using it!
3) No guarantee!
